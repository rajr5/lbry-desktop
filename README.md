# LBRY App

This is a graphical browser for the decentralized content marketplace provided by the [LBRY](https://lbry.io) protocol. It is essentially the [lbry daemon](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) bundled with a UI using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

## Development

### One-time Setup

1. Install npm and node (v6 and above required, use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md) if having trouble)
2. Install keytar and libsecret (see [keytar repository](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) )
3. Install yarn by running: npm install -g yarn (may require elevated permissions)
4. Check out this repo.
5. Set up a Python virtual environment, or live on the wild side.
6. Run `./build.sh`. This builds the UI assets and puts them into `app/dist`. It also downloads [lbry daemon](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/releases).

### Running

Run `./node_modules/.bin/electron app`

### Ongoing Development
1. `cd ui`
2. `./watch.sh`

This will set up a monitor that will automatically compile any changes to JS or CSS folders inside of the `ui` folder. This allows you to make changes and see them immediately by reloading the app.

### Packaging

We use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)
to create distributable packages, which is run by calling:

`node_modules/.bin/build -p never`

## Development on Windows

### Windows Dependency

1. Download and install `npm` and `node` from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/">nodejs.org<a>
2. Download and install `python 2.7` from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">python.org</a>
3. Download and Install `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7` from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=44266">Microsoft<a>
4. Download and install `.NET Framework 2.0 Software Development Kit (SDK) (x64)` from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=15354">Microsoft<a>

### One-time Setup
1. Open command prompt in the root of the project and run the following;
```
python -m pip install -r build\requirements.txt
python build\set_version.py
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```
2. Change directory to `app` and run the following;
```
yarn install
node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild
node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild
cd ..
```
3. Change directory to `ui` and run the following
```
yarn install
npm rebuild node-sass
node node_modules\node-sass\bin\node-sass --output dist\css --sourcemap=none scss\
node_modules\.bin\webpack --config webpack.dev.config.js
xcopy dist ..\app\dist
cd ..
```
4. Download the lbry daemon and cli binaries and place them in `app\dist\`

### Building lbry-app
1. run `node_modules\.bin\build -p never` from the root of the project.

### Running the electron app
1. Run `./node_modules/.bin/electron app`

### Ongoing Development
1. `cd ui`
2. `watch.bat`

This will set up a monitor that will automatically compile any changes to JS or CSS folders inside of the `ui` folder. This allows you to make changes and see them immediately by reloading the app.

## Internationalization

If you want to help translating the lbry-app, you can copy the en.json file in /app/locales and modify the values while leaving the keys as their original English strings. An example for this would be: `"Skip": "Ãœberspringen",` Translations should automatically show up in options.
